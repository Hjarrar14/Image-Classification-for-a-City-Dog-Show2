Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: ResNet and VGG both classified it as a golden retriever, while AlexNet classified it differently as a dingo.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No — Dog_02 was misclassified as a non-dog by all models (AlexNet/ResNet → gibbon, VGG → patas monkey), while Dog_01 was recognized as a dog breed.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes — all models correctly recognized the bear and frog images as not dogs, achieving 100% accuracy on non-dog classifications.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: ResNet (or VGG) performed best overall because they correctly identified Dog_01 as a real dog breed (golden retriever) and achieved 50% correct dog classification, compared to AlexNet’s 0%.
