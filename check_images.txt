Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: ResNet and VGG both classified it as a golden retriever, while AlexNet classified it differently as a dingo.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: None of the models classified Dog_01 and Dog_02 as the same breed. Dog_02 was classified as a non-dog (a monkey) by all the models.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All the models made mistakes and classified the non-dog images as dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:ResNet or VGG are better than AlexNet, because they achieved a higher accuracy in classifying dog images (75% compared to 50%) and were able to recognize the breed more accurately in Dog_01.
